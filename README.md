• **Project Overview**

Developed a Decision Tree model to predict heart disease in patients using clinical features. The model helps early detection, supporting doctors to identify high-risk patients quickly.

• **Dataset**

303 patient records

14 clinical features (e.g., chest pain type, cholesterol, max heart rate)

Target: Presence of heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no)

• **Key Steps**

Cleaned data and handled duplicates

Explored data via statistics and visualizations

Built initial Decision Tree achieving ~84% accuracy

Tuned hyperparameters with GridSearchCV, improving accuracy to ~90%

Visualized the tree and identified important features (chest pain type, heart rate)

• **Outcome**

An accurate, interpretable model for early heart disease detection that can be integrated into healthcare tools for better patient management and faster diagnosis.

• **Libraries**

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
